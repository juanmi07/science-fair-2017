#  Welcome to Juanâ€™s Science Project
 ##  Do mints cool things down ?

This project is fun . I enjoyed doing it.
My hypotheses was wrong. My teacher says that it means I am learning.
My project was simple.
It was also short.
The longest part was making the display.
But I also took a lot of expiriments.
I took 10  expiriments.
It was easy to get the materials.
They were cheap!
